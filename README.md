-Nft's with Royalties solves and real problem for content creators in the digital environment. For a long time the copyright authority has used a fossil to validate the existance of traditional musical content creators rights.
    The 6 basics of music copyright law

    Copyrighted work must be original. ...
    Violation of Copyright Law must be established in court. ...
    Master recording copyrights are administered (and, often, owned) by record labels. ...
    Compositional copyrights are administered by publishers. ...
    Copyrights last 70 years past the owners lifetime.
What are the basic rules of copyright?
There are three basic requirements for copyright protection: that which is to be protected must be a work of authorship; it must be original; and it must be fixed in a tangible medium of expression. What is a work of authorship?
What is unpublished work?
Unpublished works are those which have not been distributed in any manner. Although prior to 1978, copyright protection generally was available only for published works, such protection is now available for published as well as unpublished works.

The most important concept in music copyright law is that each single piece of recorded music involves two distinct rights:

    The first right protects the underlying musical composition—that is, the specific arrangement and combination of musical notes, chords, rhythm, harmonies, and song lyrics. The law refers to this first type of copyright as a “musical work.” This interest is also sometimes referred to as the “musical composition” or the “song.”
    The second right protects the actual recording of a musical composition, which copyright law refers to as the “sound recording.” This interest is also sometimes referred to as the “master” or the “recording.

While an unsigned songwriter who performs and records his or her own original songs owns both the musical work and sound recording copyrights in the song, it is often the case that the two distinct rights are owned by separate individuals or entities. In general, music publishers own or control the musical work copyright, and record companies own or control the sound recording copyright.
A music copyright, whether as a musical work or a sound recording, is created immediately upon creation and satisfaction of the following elements:

    It must be an original work of authorship; and
    It must be fixed in any tangible medium of expression, such as written sheet music, a MIDI file, or a digital (or analog) recording.

For example, as soon as an original song is written down as sheet music or recorded as a MIDI or computer sound file, a copyright is created. It is not necessary to publish the song or register a copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office. However, as we will discuss in a future blog post, registration is required to obtain certain benefits under the Copyright Act.


Know lets think about how a unique NFT that embodies the origional composition of words and music can satisfy the copyright law issue of proof of ownership,proof of work, as well as proof of stake all in one file with a smart contract.
The content creator(producer, author, writer,ect..) would be able to engage their audience in real time, build a broader fan base, have access to crowd funding, and controll of A ROYALTY stream from their specific API.

VersoriumX is owned by singer/songwriter Travis Jerome Goff, BMI award winning writer from Nashville,TN.
Versorium is planning a launch of a new project that will encompass the unique needs of creators while providing a solution to engaging an audience using blockchain tech.
