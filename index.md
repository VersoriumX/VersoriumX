## Welcome to VersoriumX

VersoriumX provides solutions to problems that arose over the past decade affecting artist across all creative economies. The .com boom and streaming services understood the consumers need to have instant as well as abundant content however, they lacked oversight in giving equal rights to the creators. The current model result is large companies holding the majority of sway over content, how it gets shared, cost, as well as receiving the lion share of the revenues generated from add, sales, etc...leaving very little for the Art creators themselves.  The bulk of what we pay for is middle man content monitazation. What came first? The Artist or the digital platform?

The new innovative ways NFTâ€™s are allowing creators/collaborators to maintain control over their work and the way in which the media is presented, sold, and monitored to minimize piracy. The contract includes the auto royalty payout function enabling automated payouts of royalty streams across all participants from the owner, creator, publisher, art consumer and the host.
Change involves challenge. VersoriumX is immersed in the pivoting web 3.0 multi-verse and will inspire a new group of creators to let their catalogue speak to a new audience
